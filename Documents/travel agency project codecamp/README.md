This is a beginner-level travel agency website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It includes pages and sections like services, destinations, and contact information.

## ✨ Features So Far
- HTML homepage layout
- Basic navigation bar
- CSS styling for layout and colors
- Folder structure: CSS, JS, images

##  🛠️ To-Do / Help Needed

- Making the site mobile responsive
